    "## Q3) Particle Identification (2 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "When conducting collision experiments at particle colliders, it is important to be able to identify what particle have been created. This can be done by allowing the products to pass through a set of detectors. Particles react to each of these detectors differently. By looking at which detectors a particle has left a signal in, the nature of that particle can be determined. For example, a photon passes through the tracking chamber unnoticed, but it produces a signal in the E/M calorimeter, where all its energy is deposited. Below is a diagram that shows the response of a set of detecters to 8 different particles:\n",
    "<div>\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The particle types are (from top to bottom) electron, photon, proton, pion, neutron, lambda, muon, and neutrino. A solid line indicates that the particle is detected passing through that detector, while a dashed line means that the particle was not detected. A branching line shows where a particle deposits its energy, continuing no further. Muons produce small signals in all detectors. Neutrinos are not detected, but are deduced from energy and momentum conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that identifies a particle based on the reading from each of the 4 detectors. A detector will either have a signal or have no signal, so the result for each detector should be a simple true or false. Each detector reading should be input by the user. Include the name of the detector when asking for each input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine which particles may have been detected using conditional statements. Output the name of the particle(s) to the screen. **(1 mark)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If an unknown particle (i.e. the detections do not match any of the patterns above) has been detected, the program should also report this. **(1 mark)**\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "- `True` and `False` can also be represented by `1` and `0` , respectively. It may be preferable to use these as the user input rather than `True` and `False` or even use `Yes` and `No` and evaluate the strings using an `if` statement\n",
    "- The particle depositing its energy also counts as a detection.\n",
