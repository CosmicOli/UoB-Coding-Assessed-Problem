    "- **All questions are marked in class by the demonstrators and can be completed in the blank assessed problems submission notebook.** You can have multiple attempts and demonstrators will give you feedback on your approach. You can often solve the problem in multiple ways but you will need to reach a required standard to receive a pass.\n",

    "You should also submit working code for each problem via the canvas upload link provided. This will be used as a record of your work, and for plagiarism and validation checks for questions. As per the introductionary notes, while coding can benefit from the input of your peers, your work should be almost entirely your own as plagiarism is not acceptable."
